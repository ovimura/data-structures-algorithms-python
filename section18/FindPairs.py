    Set: Find Pairs ( ** Interview Question)
    You are given two lists of integers, arr1 and arr2, and a target integer value, target. Your task is to find all pairs of numbers (one from arr1 and one from arr2) whose sum equals target.

    Write a function called find_pairs that takes in three arguments: arr1, arr2, and target, and returns a list of all such pairs.

    Assume that each array does not contain duplicate values.

    The tests for this exercise assume that arr1 is the list being converted to a set.

    Pairs should be returned in the order they are found while iterating through arr2.



    Input

    Your function should take in the following inputs:

    arr1: a list of integers

    arr2: a list of integers

    target: an integer



    Output

    Your function should return a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two integers from arr1 and arr2 that add up to target. The first element of each tuple should be from arr1 and the second from arr2.



    Example 1:

    arr1 = [1, 2, 3]
    arr2 = [4, 5, 6]
    target = 9
    
    pairs = find_pairs(arr1, arr2, target)
    print(pairs)
    # Expected output: [(3, 6)]
    # Explanation: There's only one pair that adds up to 9: 3 from arr1 and 6 from arr2.


    Example 2:

    arr1 = [0, 1, 2]
    arr2 = [7, 8, 9]
    target = 10
    
    pairs = find_pairs(arr1, arr2, target)
    print(pairs)
    # Expected output: [(3, 7), (2, 8), (1, 9)]
    # Explanation: The pairs that add up to 10 are (3, 7), (2, 8), and (1, 9).
    # They appear in arr2 iteration order.


    Example 3:

    arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 5]
    arr2 = [1, 3, 4, 5]
    target = 6
    
    pairs = find_pairs(arr1, arr2, target)
    print(pairs)
    # Expected output: [(5, 1), (3, 3), (2, 4), (1, 5)]
    # Explanation: The pairs that add up to 6 are (5, 1), (3, 3),
    # (2, 4), and (1, 5). Each pair consists of one element from arr1
    # and one element from arr2 that together sum to the target value.


    Example 4:

    arr1 = [1, 2, 3, 5]
    arr2 = [1, 3, 4, 5]
    target = 11
    
    pairs = find_pairs(arr1, arr2, target)
    print(pairs)
    # Expected output: []
    # Explanation: There are no pairs in arr1 and arr2 that add up to 11.
